It was about time to get back online. About time to get it done. About time to start writing about me, myself, coding, music, somewhere. I've been writing coding notes and lots of things that would be a shame to be keep them in a folder that is sooner or later gonna go through the process of archival.

I never stopped writing, I just stopped sharing stuff with the world. It just happened to me that I needed to take some time off the pressure I've created on myself. I feel better and stronger than ever. Even if stones would be falling from the sky I managed to build myself a strong shell of confidence that has kept me going ever since.

Last year the biggest social media platform got in the way of my life in a way that I would have never expected before, in a good and in a bad way, both at the same time. I do miss that fake sense of being connected to lots of friends from time to time, on the other hand, it made me realize which human relations where the one that would stay strong through time. In the last 9 years I lived in 5 different countries and met people from all over the world, obviously switched phone numbers more than once, and so, I came to the conclusion that it is in my power to keep those connections strong. It is only by owning your data that we get the freedom we deserve.

Big corporations are getting under our nails, they're nasty, they get

Sadly I needed them to invade my private life in exchange of my freedom. (?). It is not as bad as it sounds actually.

I never stopped believing in me. And that is no pocket money.
