# About

Hi! I'm Christian!

I was born and raised in Buenos Aires, Argentina, in the middle of a little Slovenian diaspora

I moved to Europe in 2010, lived in Brussels, Klagenfurt, Ljubljana and since 2015, Berlin

I have worked as a front-end developer for media and advertisement agencies, to the point I decided I needed some fresh air and switched jobs completely. That's how I learned about specialty coffee and improved my soft skills while managing a small café

After a while, I felt the urge to get back to coding, and decided to work on improving and refreshing my skillset. After an almost 2 year break from active development, I went all-in with the JS ecosystem. I recently finished a coding bootcamp at DCI.

My preferred tools today include: node, express, React, Redux, Gatsby... amongst other. Interested in taking my knowledge to the top of the profession as I'm an avid and fast learner. You can find examples of my code on Github or the porfolio section of this site.

If you would like to know more about my professional life, let's talk on Linkedin. I can speak English, Spanish, Slovenian, and German (B1).

When my text editor is not open and I'm not procrastinating you would probably find me in some music related project. Some possible options are: digging records, shopping on bandcamp, DJing, organizing an event with Imaginary Radio Stations, preparing a playlist for Radio Študent working on my music or simply listening to music on-the-go and enjoying nature.

Currently open to new opportunities.

PS: Don't forget to follow me on twitter and check the source code of this website, maybe even a PR?
